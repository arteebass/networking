 README file for Project 3 - Simple TCP
           Name(s): Rueben Tiow, Hunter Garret, Jacob Johnson
================================================

USAGE:
1. Run server with ./server
2. Server can be quit by signaling CTRL+C
3. Run client with [-q] [-f <filename>] server:port

OVERVIEW:
This project implements a "Simple" Transport Control Protocol (STCP) which is a stripped
down version of TCP. 

IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN DECISION:
1. Connection state enumerations were defined and used on an "as needed" basis.
2. Based on need, our context_t manages these resources:
  - connection state
  - sequence number
  - received sequence number
  - receiver window size
  - receiver buffer
  - sender buffer
3. Three-way handshaking mimics that of traditional TCP
4. After a connection is established, on three events are handled:
  - Application data
  - Network data
  - Application close request

IMPLEMENTED:															
1. Sliding Window(s)
  - Fixed size: 3072 bytes
  - A receive window
  - A sender window = min(receive window, congestion window)
2. TCP segment send/receive
3. Connection Setup/Teardown

LIMITATIONS:
1. Congestion Control not implemented for simplicity.
2. Since a reliable network layer is assumed, timeouts, packet loss, and
reordering of packets is not supported.
